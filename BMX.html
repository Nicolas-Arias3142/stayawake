                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMX started in the early 1970’s when kids would race their BMX bikes on dirt trails and tracks that they made, they were inspired by motocross and the racers. Making their own tracks and using their BMX bikes was a good alternative to having to buy a motocross bike and all the care that is required to do motocross. This is how BMX racing became such a big sport in the 70’s and 80’s. Racers would then modify their BMX bikes for BMX racing, to make them handle better and have better performance to race. BMX freestyle was becoming popular as BMX riders would create new stylistic ways to ride. This started out with doing more flat ground tricks, like balancing on one wheel and doing more balance spinning oriented tricks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tricks would gain large amounts of viewers because of the difficulty of them. This is where the more freestyle side of BMX was starting to become a dominant part of the sport. Riders would then incorporate the racing part with the freestyle, adding large dirt ramps and doing tricks while in the air. As more riders got into freestyle the limits would be beat and pushed farther doing bigger and more dangerous tricks. It became a very dangouse way of riding BMX but because of this it would gain a lot of popularity because of the risk factor involved, people who had no idea in BMX would watch because of the crazy stunts. Companies and tv stations were made to sponsor these riders and host events for viewers to watch from home, one of the biggest being <div class="BMXLinks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games" target="_blank">X-Games.</a></div></p>

                <p>BMX has then been improving and new styles of riding have been made by people all over the world. BMX is now a very known sport and have been growing because of the independence and creativity you can do in it.</p>
